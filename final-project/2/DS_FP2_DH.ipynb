    "Recent articles have pointed out that San Francisco, as well as other cities, have shortages of health (food/restaurant) inspectors. My idea is to determine if SF health department food inspection scores can be predicted based on Yelp data (excluding user reviews which would entail natural language processing which is beyond the scope of this project/course). This could allow better resource allocation for health inspectors.\n",

    "My guess is that the following factors would most impact the predicted food inspection score: \n",

    "- main type of cuisine served (categorical)\n",

    "- Yelp rating (numeric; 0-5 stars in 0.5 increments -> 0-10 as integer)\n",

    "I will have questions about scraping data from Yelp. The API they provide doesn't return all the value I'm interested in. I plan to first use their API to get the bulk of the data and then scrape to get additional info like price range if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the use the Yelp API (or scrape Yelp), you need a way to look up the specific establishment using one of several different methods. The easiest appears to be using the telephone number but it is not provided for all establishments. I'll likely have to run additional API calls using alternate methods to get the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some discrepencies between the Yelp and Health Inspection data. Health inspection scores are collected only at certain times, like when a new restaurant opens, which means they aren't collected at random intervals which would be less biased. You could imagine a new restaurant would be cleaner and/or in a newly renovated building more up to code than a much older establishment. Therefore some thinking will have to go into how to handle the inspection scores. In contrast, Yelp data is collected continually over time and presented according to their internal guidelines which are not transparent."

    "I would expect the output to be the predicted classification of an establishment's health inspection score vs. the actual score. Since the goal is to better allocate or prioritize health inspection resources, the model would just need to be correct more often than it's wrong in order to be useful. The inspections still need to be carried out regardless - eventually. But finding the lower performing establishments is the goal, not simply confirming the higher performers. It would be considered a waste of resources to inspect 'good' (>90) establishments. Additionally, if the model was 100% accurate, there would be no need for health inspections which is of course not realistic given the random nature of the violations that are cited (e.g. holes forming in walls that could allow vermin entrance). If the project doesn't pan out as planned, I would look into possible explanatory factors based upon the results."
